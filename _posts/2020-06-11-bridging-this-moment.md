note: "These remarks were originally prepared for the MIT
       Community Vigil held on on June 2, 2020 in the wake of the
       murders of Ahmaud Aubery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, 
       and Tony McDade."

I was not originally planning to share about this, but early in June,
I was speaking with one of my brothers in the faith, a Black man. He
described to me that his six-year-old daughter heard about what
happened to George Floyd through a community conversation, and she
started asking questions: "What is racism?" "What does it mean?" Then
my friend and his wife told their daughter, answering her questions as
best they could. And the next day, he asked his daughter, as he did
every day, "What was your favorite thing about today?" <!--more-->

And she says, "that you came home safe."

Let that sink in.

No six-year-old should have to be concerned for the rest of her life
about the safety of her daddy because of the color of his skin. So
when we talk about injustice, it's not just the system, it's not just
an incident, it's not just a video. It's children. It's people. It's a
lifetime of trauma and mindset that we, as Black people, have to adapt
to.

There is a tendency to distance ourselves from the events going on in
the country. We have the ability to frame what we see in the news as
"*over there*," mostly separate from our personal lives "*over here*."
However, today that separation is not present for Black people. The
things we see in a video are on the continuum of our lived
experiences.

Let's bring this home. As hard as it is to admit, the modern-day
lynching of George Floyd is on the continuum of our experiences with
inequities in education, representation, and support in the student
body and faculty of MIT. As hard as it is to admit, the protests on
the streets in more than 140 cities across America and their
documented sabotage by incendiary groups is on the continuum of the
Black History Month installation in Lobby 7 in 2019 and its
[desecration with a drawn
swastika](https://thetech.com/2019/02/07/swastika-on-black-hack). In
the same way that survivors of assault can be triggered by seeing
their perpetrator, as Black people we are *triggered and traumatized*
recalling the ongoing assault--devaluation and death--whenever we see
our perpetrator--racism--in all of its many forms.

I share all of this to ask you to see with eyes unafraid to examine
this continuum in yourself and the spaces you hold. And I speak with
hope, knowing that recognition is the first step in the continual work
of restoration.
