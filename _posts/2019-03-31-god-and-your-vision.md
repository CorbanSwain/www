title: God & Your Vision

<p> I often find myself wanting to pursue a certain goal or set a
	certain habit for myself. There are many things which I am drawn
	to and passionate about pursuing. For me, this extends from lofty
	world-changing goals to simple minutia of daily life. One of my
	goals for this year is to create and showcase a series of
	scientific artworks, another is to work out for fifteen minutes
	every day. Some of my loftier goals are to see the Black graduate
	<!--more-->
	student community at MIT become a vibrant, active, and supportive
	space that has a sustained and measurable impact on the policies
	and culture of our campus; and to develop a new programming
	language which provides a semantic framework for analyzing and
	developing theories about the functional and physical structure of
	the brain. &#8230; Don't worry, I&rsquo;m not sure what that last one
	actually means either.
</p>

<p>
	As much as I can go on about my goals and dreams, I&rsquo;m confident
	you can--and likely have--shared about your dreams and goals in
	the same way. There are commitments you want to stick to,
	challenges you want to conquer, systems you want to see disrupted,
	and people you want to reach. With those things in mind, I want to
	challenge you in two ways. One, do you know how to chart and
	navigate the path from where you are now to where you want to be?
	Two, are you confident that those things you have set out to do
	are at the limit of what you can attain?
</p>

<p>
	Since childhood, it has been my goal to become a scientist. I
	pursued this goal by learning as much as I could in as many ways
	as I could. I went to university with the intention of making this
	dream a reality; I was confident that it was the place that I
	needed to be. However, despite being in what I thought were
	perfect conditions to become who I wanted to become, things didn&rsquo;t
	work out how I wanted. I ended up in a very dark place and lost
	hope of those things I wanted to accomplish and, ultimately, I
	walked away. Literally. Late one night during my junior year I
	walked west from my dorm down Forsyth Blvd.; wearing nothing but
	pajamas, I was prepared to completely detach myself from
	everything and everyone I knew. Despite my belief that school was
	exactly where I needed to be, God spoke to me in that moment and
	said &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stay at school.&rdquo; God would
	have it that I step away from school to be equipped for a greater
	purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Over the nine months that I spent at home away from school, I
	learned and grew more than any year I was in college. It was
	during that time I took on my faith in God as a personal belief
	and was surrounded by mentors who helped me to grow
	spiritually. After a past of rarely communicating well in
	relationships, I experienced, for the first time a romantic
	relationship that had honest and consistent communication. I took
	the step of seeing a mental health counselor every week. I gained
	research experience, completing a project in poly(amino-acid)
	chemistry at a local laboratory. I found a greater appreciation
	for all my parents had taught me and been for me. I gained more
	than 100 hours of experience tutoring and teaching math and
	science to other students. God would have it that my goal of
	becoming a scientist by going to university be expanded and
	upturned: away from school I was not only prepared for science,
	but I was also given the spiritual and relational foundations to
	be able to empower and uplift others in many ways.

</p>

<p>
	So back to my original questions: Do you know how to navigate the
	path from where you are now to where you want to be?  And are you
	confident that those things you have set out to do are at the
	limit of what you can attain?  Consider that your creator, God,
	would have it that you accomplish much more than you can ever
	imagine in ways that you could have never thought to pursue. I
	encourage you
