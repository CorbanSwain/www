I often find myself wanting to pursue a certain goal or set a certain
habit for myself. There are many things which I am drawn to and
passionate about pursuing. For me, this extends from lofty
world-changing goals to simple minutia of daily life. One of my
goals for this year is to create and showcase a series of
scientific artworks, another is to work out for fifteen minutes
every day. Some of my loftier goals are to see the Black graduate
 student community at MIT<!--more--> become a vibrant, active, and
supportive space that has a sustained and measurable impact on the
policies and culture of our campus; and to develop a new
programming language which provides a semantic framework for
analyzing and developing theories about the functional and
physical structure of the brain. &#8230; Don&rsquo;t worry,
I&rsquo;m not sure what that last one actually means either.

As much as I can go on about my goals and dreams, I&rsquo;m confident
you can&mdash;and likely have&mdash;shared about your dreams and goals
in the same way. There are commitments you want to stick to,
challenges you want to conquer, systems you want to see disrupted, and
people you want to reach. With those things in mind, I want to
challenge you in two ways. One, do you know how to chart and navigate
the path from where you are now to where you want to be? Two, are you
confident that those things you have set out to do are at the limit of
what you can attain?

Since childhood, it has been my goal to become a scientist. I pursued
this goal by learning as much as I could in as many ways as I
could. I went to university with the intention of making this
dream a reality; I was confident that it was the place that I
needed to be. However, despite being in what I thought were
perfect conditions to become who I wanted to become, things
didn&rsquo;t work out how I wanted. I ended up in a very dark
place and lost hope of those things I wanted to accomplish and,
ultimately, I walked away. Literally. Late one night during my
junior year I walked west from my dorm down Forsyth Blvd.; wearing
nothing but pajamas, I was prepared to completely detach myself
from everything and everyone I knew. Despite my belief that school
was exactly where I needed to be, God spoke to me in that moment
and said &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to stay at school.&rdquo; *God
would have it* that I step away from school to be equipped for a
greater purpose.

Over the nine months that I spent at home away from school, I learned
and grew more than any year I was in college. It was during that
time I took on my faith in God as a personal belief and was
surrounded by mentors who helped me to grow spiritually. After a
past of rarely communicating well in relationships, I experienced,
for the first time a romantic relationship that had honest and
consistent communication. I took the step of seeing a mental
health counselor every week. I gained research experience,
completing a project in poly(amino-acid) chemistry at a local
laboratory. I found a greater appreciation for all my parents had
taught me and been for me. I gained more than 100 hours of
experience tutoring and teaching math and science to other
students. *God would have it* that my goal of becoming a scientist
by going to university be expanded and upturned: away from school
I was not only prepared for science, but I was also given the
spiritual and relational foundations to be able to empower and
uplift others in many ways.

So back to my original questions: 

  > One, do you know how to navigate the path from where you are now
  to where you want to be?  And two, are you confident that those
  things you have set out to do are at the limit of what you can
  attain?
  
__Consider that your creator, *God, would have it* that you accomplish
much more than you can ever imagine in ways that you could have never
thought to pursue.__ With that in mind, I encourage you to take five
minutes today to pray that God&rsquo;s plan, and not your own, would
be the driving force in every area of your life.
