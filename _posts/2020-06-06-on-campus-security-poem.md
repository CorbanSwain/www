note: "This poem is a reharmonization (as my jazz friends might say) of an email sent by members of an MIT residential floor community to advertise a party themed &ldquo;Dorm Security&rdquo; early in the spring semester of 2020 (the original email itself being derived from a song by comedian Rob Cantor). Everywhere in the poem that you see bold, monospace text, the original email contained the text <em>&ldquo;Average black male around 5 ft 6&Prime; wearing a blue backpack.&rdquo;</em> The original email repeated this phrase nine times jokingly referencing a police description of a suspected dorm intruder. Although an apology was made, for Black folks on campus, this unfortunately served as yet another example of how we were not welcome on campus. Here, I choose to leverage the narrative of the original email to shape a new narrative about the struggle for the inclusivity and security of Black students on campus."

You&rsquo;re\
&emsp;walking in the halls\
There&rsquo;s\
&emsp;no one around and the lights are out\
Out\
&emsp;of the corner of your eye you spot it:\
**Racism.**
<!--more-->

It&rsquo;s\
&emsp;following you, about zero feet back\
It\
&emsp;gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint\
It&rsquo;s\
&emsp;gaining on you!\
**Concealed\
&emsp;As an honest mistake, an unvetted email.**

You&rsquo;re\
&emsp;looking for your room, but you&rsquo;ve locked yourself out\
It&rsquo;s\
&emsp;almost upon you now\
And\
&emsp;you can see there&rsquo;s its face on its face\
My\
&emsp;God, there&rsquo;s its face everywhere!

Running\
&emsp;for your life (from **the empty promise of\
&emsp;diversity and inclusion**)\
It&rsquo;s\
&emsp;louder than the pipes (It&rsquo;s **&ldquo;YOU&rsquo;RE\
&emsp;NOT WELCOME HERE!&rdquo;**)\
Lurking\
&emsp;in the shadows\
Recurrent\
&emsp;Door Surfer **sloshing from the streets of America\
&emsp;onto the halls of MIT**

Living\
&emsp;in the basement? (**William Barton Rogers and\
&emsp;the enslaved people his family owned**)\
Searching\
&emsp;for a Nelly? (**because only a student ID can\
&emsp;un-thug the Black man**)\
Put\
&emsp;it on a slingshot\
Actual\
&emsp;cannonball&mdash;**iron skin too thick\
&emsp;to let this come between me and my degree**

Now\
&emsp;it&rsquo;s dark and you seem to have lost it\
But\
&emsp;you&rsquo;re hopelessly lost yourself\
Stranded\
&emsp;with a stranger\
You\
&emsp;creep silently through the trash chute

Aha!\
&emsp;In the distance\
A\
&emsp;small hatch with a light on\
Hope!\
&emsp;You move stealthily toward it\
But\
&emsp;your leg! Ah! It&rsquo;s caught in our Shit!

Gnawing\
&emsp;off your leg (Quiet, quiet)\
Limping\
&emsp;to the Hivemind (Quiet, quiet)\
Now\
&emsp;you&rsquo;re at our party\
Sitting\
&emsp;inside: **A lie,\
&emsp;instead of a home.**
