note: "This poem is a reharmonization (as my jazz friends might say) of an email sent by members of an MIT residential floor community to advertise a party themed &ldquo;Dorm Security&rdquo; early in the spring semester of 2020 (the original email itself being derived from a song by comedian Rob Cantor). Everywhere in the poem that you see bold, monospace text, the original email contained the text <em>&ldquo;Average black male around 5 ft 6&Prime; wearing a blue backpack.&rdquo;</em> The original email repeated this phrase nine times jokingly referencing a police description of a suspected dorm intruder. Although an apology was made, for Black folks on campus, this unfortunately served as yet another example of how we were not welcome on campus. Here, I choose to leverage the narrative of the original email to shape a new narrative about the struggle for the inclusivity and security of Black students on campus."

You&rsquo;re<br>
&emsp;walking in the halls<br>
There&rsquo;s<br>
&emsp;no one around and the lights are out<br>
Out<br>
&emsp;of the corner of your eye you spot it:<br>
**Racism.**
<!--more-->

It&rsquo;s<br>
&emsp;following you, about zero feet back<br>
It<br>
&emsp;gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint<br>
It&rsquo;s<br>
&emsp;gaining on you!<br>
**Concealed<br>
&emsp;As an honest mistake, an unvetted email.**

You&rsquo;re<br>
&emsp;looking for your room, but you&rsquo;ve locked yourself out<br>
It&rsquo;s<br>
&emsp;almost upon you now<br>
And<br>
&emsp;you can see there&rsquo;s its face on its face<br>
My<br>
&emsp;God, there&rsquo;s its face everywhere!

Running<br>
&emsp;for your life (from **the empty promise of<br>
&emsp;diversity and inclusion**)<br>
It&rsquo;s<br>
&emsp;louder than the pipes (It&rsquo;s **&ldquo;YOU&rsquo;RE<br>
&emsp;NOT WELCOME HERE!&rdquo;**)<br>
Lurking<br>
&emsp;in the shadows<br>
Recurrent<br>
&emsp;Door Surfer **sloshing from the streets of America<br>
&emsp;onto the halls of MIT**

Living<br>
&emsp;in the basement? (**William Barton Rogers and<br>
&emsp;the enslaved people his family owned**)<br>
Searching<br>
&emsp;for a Nelly? (**because only a student ID can<br>
&emsp;un-thug the Black man**)<br>
Put<br>
&emsp;it on a slingshot<br>
Actual<br>
&emsp;cannonball&mdash;**iron skin too thick<br>
&emsp;to let this come between me and my degree**

Now<br>
&emsp;it&rsquo;s dark and you seem to have lost it<br>
But<br>
&emsp;you&rsquo;re hopelessly lost yourself<br>
Stranded<br>
&emsp;with a stranger<br>
You<br>
&emsp;creep silently through the trash chute

Aha!<br>
&emsp;In the distance<br>
A<br>
&emsp;small hatch with a light on<br>
Hope!<br>
&emsp;You move stealthily toward it<br>
But<br>
&emsp;your leg! Ah! It&rsquo;s caught in our Shit!

Gnawing<br>
&emsp;off your leg (Quiet, quiet)<br>
Limping<br>
&emsp;to the Hivemind (Quiet, quiet)<br>
Now<br>
&emsp;you&rsquo;re at our party<br>
Sitting<br>
&emsp;inside: **A lie,<br>
&emsp;instead of a home.**
