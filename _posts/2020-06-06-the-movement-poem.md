There is a movement in us\
us beaten, us broken\
us kindred once stolen\
There is a movement in us\
All starved and choked\
In endless woke\
There is a movement in us
<!--more-->

*Like tears forcibly held back,\
Allowed to see through the eyes,\
But never able to change their gaze\
Finally pushing out of the tear ducts\
Streaming around the plump cheeks on\
The smiling face of their country.\
As the tears crash into the ground\
They cry out to the Lord &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;*

*&ldquo;America,&rdquo; He says,\
&ldquo;Will you join hands with the tree that grows watered by tears?\
Will you be cut by her bark, be healed of your fears?\
Will you give up  injustice&mdash;axe and sin held too dear?\
Will you say to the tree &lsquo;live free and live here&rsquo;?&rdquo;*

There is a movement in her\
Whether joined at the side,\
Or left hanging, left dry\
There is a movement in her,\
All earth and crown\
Crimson and brown\
We are the movement for sure\
Tired of mourning unseen,\
We march to the morning of A Dream

There is a move in the heart\
There is a move of the mind\
There is a move by the Spirit\
So the only word I can find is

Move. Move.\
From your pockets,\
With your voices,\
On your feet,\
MOVE!
