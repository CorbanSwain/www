There is a movement in us<br>
us beaten, us broken<br>
us kindred once stolen<br>
There is a movement in us<br>
All starved and choked<br>
In endless woke<br>
There is a movement in us
<!--more-->

*Like tears forcibly held back,<br>
Allowed to see through the eyes,<br>
But never able to change their gaze<br>
Finally pushing out of the tear ducts<br>
Streaming around the plump cheeks on<br>
The smiling face of their country.<br>
As the tears crash into the ground<br>
They cry out to the Lord &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo;*

*&ldquo;America,&rdquo; He says,<br>
&ldquo;Will you join hands with the tree that grows watered by tears?<br>
Will you be cut by her bark, be healed of your fears?<br>
Will you give up  injustice&mdash;axe and sin held too dear?<br>
Will you say to the tree &lsquo;live free and live here&rsquo;?&rdquo;*

There is a movement in her<br>
Whether joined at the side,<br>
Or left hanging, left dry<br>
There is a movement in her,<br>
All earth and crown<br>
Crimson and brown<br>
We are the movement for sure<br>
Tired of mourning unseen,<br>
We march to the morning of A Dream

There is a move in the heart<br>
There is a move of the mind<br>
There is a move by the Spirit<br>
So the only word I can find is

Move. Move.<br>
From your pockets,<br>
With your voices,<br>
On your feet,<br>
MOVE!
