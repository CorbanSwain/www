*What does liberation look like? <br> 
Will you like how it looks when
we&rsquo;re free?*

<!--more-->
As a boy, I remember squirming in the church pew on Sunday Mornings
doodling contraptions and inventions in the sermon notes section of
the program. And when that wasn&rsquo;t intriguing enough,
my mother would scribble down a collection of x&rsquo;s, y&rsquo;s,
and equal signs, then ask me to &ldquo;&hellip;solve&hellip;&rdquo; to
keep me awake. Monday through Friday I attended school at that same
Black Baptist church, and many in the community knew of my academic
achievements. So when Sunday service was dismissed, I remember
shuffling through slacks and heels looking up at warm faces declaring
how I was destined for greatness; many so bold as to call me
&ldquo;Professor&rdquo; from the age of 8 years old.

There was a rush that came from being lauded week after week, and
these prophecies expanded the horizons I saw for my own future.

And it all came true. My mother&rsquo;s math puzzles transformed into
biomedical engineering problem sets during my undergrad at Washington
University in St. Louis. Those doodles transformed into designs for
microscopes that can peer into the brain for my work in [Ed
Boyden&rsquo;s lab](https://syntheticneurobiology.org/) at MIT.

My path so far, and my presumptive path forward to professorship or
industry leadership, is evidence of the very social progress that King
and others fought for &hellip; right? As grateful as I am, I&rsquo;m sitting
with the question:

**Is Black achievement indicative of Black liberation?**

I&rsquo;ve had to consider that my journey&mdash;one inspired by
seeing people like me represented in science and one driven by my
desire to be one of those representatives who can be looked at by the
next generation&mdash;I had to consider that this path was imperfect.

The *politics* of who gets to be first, or second, or even who gets to
be fiftieth are not the same *paradigms* that get everyone free.

Let me say that again: The *politics* of who gets to be the first
Black astronaut, or the second Black woman nuclear engineer, or even
who gets to be the fiftieth Black student body president are not the
same *paradigms* that get everyone free.

Applying this in the context of MIT, we have to question if it&rsquo;s
enough to be proponents of diversity and inclusion. Dr. D-L
Stewart proposes that we would be better to [stand for equity and
justice](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/03/30/colleges-need-language-shift-not-one-you-think-essay),
stating:
* &ldquo;Diversity asks, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s in the room?&rsquo; Equity
  responds: &lsquo;Who is trying to get in the room but can&rsquo;t?
  Whose presence in the room is under constant threat of
  erasure?&rsquo;&#8239;&rdquo;
* &ldquo;Inclusion asks, &lsquo;Is this environment safe for everyone
  to feel like they belong?&rsquo; Justice challenges, &lsquo;Whose
  safety is being sacrificed and minimized to allow others to be
  comfortable maintaining dehumanizing views?&rsquo;&#8239;&rdquo;

Diversity and inclusion allow us to complacently define liberation as
representation. Equity and justice force us to reframe liberation as
so much more. Can we stretch our imaginations to take actions that
uphold equity and justice holistically?
* What if students saw the endpoint of their time at MIT not as
  graduation day, but as the day when they were humble enough to learn
  from the knowledge of those who&rsquo;ve never been in the academy?
* What if MIT engaged with its own history of slavery beyond [research
  and awareness](https://libraries.mit.edu/mit-and-slavery/), to the
  point of completely divesting from all arms of the modern parallel:
  carceral and prison systems?
* What if the MIT community saw as its mission to disable all
  technologies that uphold inequity and injustice in all its
  forms&mdash;imperialism, sexism, queerphobia, racism? What if we saw
  this mission as so important that we were willing to challenge the
  foundations of the Institute&rsquo;s existence to see it through to
  fruition?

Now, I don&rsquo;t have all the answers. But in church, I did learn
some things from those Sunday sermons. I learned that God defends the
widow, the orphan, and the migrant. I learned that our Creator values
us not because we&rsquo;ve &ldquo;made it in the room,&rdquo; but by
the nature of our sacred humanity. I want us to do likewise.

I want us to see liberation as bound to the humanization of the most
minoritized among us even when it comes at a significant sacrifice of
our own. Let&rsquo;s honor the marginalized not on our terms, but on
theirs.
