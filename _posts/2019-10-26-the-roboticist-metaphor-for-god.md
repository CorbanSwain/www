I recently learned about the helocopter robot that NASA has developed
for working with robots to create a robot capable of flyingon
mars. Everything about this robot has been developed and optimized to
sucssfully fly on mars. It has insulation is the exact amount for its
lelectronics to survie the cold nights. Its rotors spin up at the
precise speed and are of the propper weight to fly in the thin
air. It's weight has been designed to be as small as possible while
still carying all of the necessary functions. This machine has been
optimized on so many levels for the purpose of achaiving flight on the
surface of mars.

But what if, halfway on the two year journey to the red planet, XXX
robot decides that it will be a better idea to change course and head
to jupiter. "How cool would it be to see fly on the biggest planet in
the solar system"

The engineers miight reply--only after coming to terms with the first
interstellar anthropomorphic AI--that there is absolutely no wa it
would survive on Jupiter. After all it wasnt designs for flight is
it's atmosphere or at a place with its pressures. Indeed Acting so
contrary to design will lead to immenent failure.

I dont want to stifle creativity ...

To be contoniues

God has ultimately designed us for a purpose.

1) at the level of humanity he has created us to reflect Him.

2) At a personal level he has given each of usunique set of designs
optimized for what he wishes for us to acomplish. Let's think about
what this means for finding the best way to live. ... It means we need
to see the guidance of our designs to know how to properly carry out
our mission and live sustainibu.
